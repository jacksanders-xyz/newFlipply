##About
Learning to skateboard can be difficult, one point of resistance in the process of learning flip 
tricks is an inability to understand how the board flips and rotates. Being able to visualize the 
tricks helps you keep track of whats going on and better optimize your movements and ability on a 
skateboard. Jump start this process with flipply! 

An App geared for skateboarders of all age groups and skill-levels, flipply allows you to see in 
augmented reality the flip tricks that YOU want to learn. The tricks come with descriptions, 
instructions and resources for doing them and are also presented in the most optimal order for 
learning, guiding your progress from beginner to advanced.
