        {"\n\n"} You've conquered the ollie, perhaps you can even do it
        while moving. But now you're ready for your first flip trick. 
        {"\n\n"}PRE-REQUISITES:
        An Ollie... even better if you can do one while moving. Perhaps even a backside 180.
        {"\n\n"}
        STEPS: 
        {"\n\n"} Foot position: 
        front foot is right before the bolts, maybe turned a little bit towards the nose. 
        back foot is about where it was for the Ollie, except nudged forward a bit so that your toes are hanging off a bit.
        {"\n"}
        STEPS:{"\n\n"}
        1. Pop with flick {"\n\n"}  
        Where things start to get different from the Ollie is the role of
        your back foot... Your back foot is going to pops down you are also
        going to flick it behind you. This will generate the movement which
        spins the board horizontally.
        {"\n\n"}
        2.Front foot movement {"\n\n"} Just as you back foot has gained
        a new role, so has your front foot: As you drag it upwards (just
          as you would in an Ollie) you will also keep it more flat. When
        doing Just an Ollie, you have the option to "steeze it out" by
        really rolling your front ankle up the board as it goes out. With
        the Pop Shuv, the front foot needs to be a bit flatter, as it will
        act as a horizontal point of rotation. Think of it as fulcrum, which
        your board will rotate around. This is very Important as It will
        control the rotation AND allow you to catch the board with your
        front foot as it comes around. 
        {"\n\n"}
        3.Level Out {"\n\n"} 

        Leveling out in this case means less "going forward with your front
        foot" and more picking up your back foot to meet the same level as
        your front. Don't get me wrong, your front goes forward to level out
        a bit... But you won't feel it as much. Remember, whatever flip
        trick your doing, the Ollie is always there and you need keep in
        mind the ollie fundamentals. It's spooky the amount of tricks where
        if you just think "Ollie first", you will do them. 
        {"\n\n"}
        4. Catch that board and land {"\n\n"} Click below to take a peek!
